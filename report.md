# BASIC Report by Patrick Palad

Learning BASIC in these past weeks has been challenging, and I think
the most important thing that I have gained in these past weeks, is an
appreciation for the programs built using BASIC. This is a similar to the
feeling I had when I initially started programming in MIPS, but in a way my
appreciation for BASIC programs is more real. With MIPS, I had never really
understood or seen what people do with that language, but with BASIC it's
different. I remember hearing about and seeing games made using BASIC, and
only now do I have a full understanding of just how difficult it must have
been to make those games.

The first thing - and maybe even the biggest thing - that became difficult
for me, was having to put line numbers at the beginning of every single
line of code. During the practicals, this was never that big of an issue, more
of a nuisance than anything. However, during my time developing the final
project, it became increasingly harder to manage the line numbers. The biggest
issue I faced regarding this practice was that if you didn't plan ahead with
your line numbering, you could run into tedious issues. For example, if
you had line 31, and then line 32, but then needed to do something in between
those lines, you would have to potentially reorder 10+ line numbers. While
this is rather trivial considering it only takes a couple of seconds, over
time this constant reordering wastes time, and also degrades the quality of
the overall project. Even following examples I've seen in other BASIC programs
of having intervals of 10 or 25 between lines, I quickly found myself having
to resort to increasing levels of granularity to complete the project

The other significant challenge that I faced was the reliance on GOTO and
GOSUB commands to handle workflow. While I've worked with these in the past,
any project that requires jumping directly around a program is inherently
difficult to work with, because it is so easy to jump to the wrong place, or
mishandle the way you are jumping from place to place. My final project
lent itself to multiple GOTO statements, and as a result the code itself is
quite hard to follow. Yet another challenge that I faced when learning BASIC
was just the overall syntax regarding variables. There are some little
intricacies to BASIC that I was unprepared for and were difficult to
learn about when first starting. The biggest of these was that variables are
only differentiated by their first two characters. This particular quirk
led to a long session of debugging, when two variables with the same first two
characters were sharing values.

Overall, I enjoyed my time working with BASIC and getting to know the basics
and some of the more advanced features of the language. Many of the challenges
that I ran into were solved relatively easily, but that was due to the scale of
the programs we created. A more full features program in BASIC is something
that I think would be interesting, if not incredibly difficult to write. The
lack of any framework within BASIC is freeing, but also incredibly daunting.
Considering that I am most used to OOP using higher level languages, thinking
of things that I could feasibly do in BASIC was difficult. Throughout the
learning process the group would envision that it would be possible to do
something, and then quickly learn that we had aimed too high. We would then
adjust our expectations and aim a little lower. This process happened many,
many times, and eventually we all finally understood the difficulty of working
with BASIC. I am still glad to have finished the projects and learned some
BASIC, despite the difficulties. The respect I have for the programmers who
started with BASIC, and learned during this time period has definitely
increased. Going forward I fully expect to do my own investigating into
other lower level languages to get a better picture of what the programmers
of the past had to deal with in order to better appreciate their work.
